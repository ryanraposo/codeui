## Colors

Use the built-in color picker, enter custom values, or choose from over 2k preset colors. Store your favorites via ```codeui.favoriteColors```

## Customization

Apply color customizations by theme and workspace. Darken, lighten, copy & paste values across items. Use Standard or Palette view to sort by element groups or target specific colors wherever they appear

*Note: customizations are applied to the current theme by default.
