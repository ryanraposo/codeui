[![LoveIt;ShipIt](https://gitlab.com/ryanraposo/LoveItShipIt/-/raw/master/sticker/loveitshipit.svg)](http://github.com/ryanraposo/LoveItShipIt)

Below is a reaffirmation from the maintainers of this project to our contributor counterparts.

[LoveIt;ShipIt](https://github.com/ryanraposo/LoveItShipIt) is...

    1. The order of operations in the project, and so better stands to be.
    2. The standard for all changes, and so better stands to be.
    3. The ideal communication between members of the project, above all else.

The maintainer(s) of CodeUI have reaffirmed with honest belief...

    1. That these reaffirmations preserve the true value of the project.
    2. That contributors can expect the highest possible degree of respect as a result.
    3. That doing so is the surest way to invoke the sentiment from users.

I think it's time to give me all your praises  
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises  
My life is on these words, this is my affidavit
